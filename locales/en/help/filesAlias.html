  <p>Aliases allow you to set any URL that returns the contents of any resource
  available in the <code>/public</code> for your blog.</p>
  <p>The target of the alias must be an element of the media manager's blog.
  The URL alias will deliver the target without revealing the real media URL.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, it's a classic redirect to the destination of the alias.</p>
  <p>And if in addition you have chosen to create an alias disposable, it
  self-delete after the first access to the URL in your browser.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Destination</dt>
    <dd>The destination of the alias is an existing item in the library of blog.
    This field is required.</dd>

    <dt>URL (alias)</dt>
    <dd>The alias is the URL that you create, not the blog URL. URL aliases
    called "about" will be recognized when someone called http://yourblog/about.</dd>
